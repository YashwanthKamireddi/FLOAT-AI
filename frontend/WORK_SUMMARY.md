# Frontend Work Summary (FloatChat)

Date: 2025-09-28

## What we delivered

- Chat experience
  - Removed personas; unified, left-aligned chat bubbles for both sides.
  - Auto-growing textarea composer (no scrollbars) with reliable bottom padding that persists via MutationObserver.
  - "New message" status/badge positioned above the fixed input so the latest reply is never obscured.
  - Small UX polish: trimmed command button label text; consistent spacing on the 8pt grid.

- Analytics & tabs
  - Only the active tab renders (lazy mount) for better performance.
  - Analysis panel table scrolls inside a Radix ScrollArea (no stray page scrollbars).
  - SQL panel visually aligned with other panels; readable, inlined code style.
  - Tab list wraps when content overflows; horizontal scrollbar removed.

- Layout & styling system
  - Mission/viewscreen shells simplified; redundant borders/overlays removed.
  - Consistent paddings and heights to keep charts, tables, and chat aligned.

- Code health
  - Recharts wrappers tightened with explicit TypeScript payload types.
  - Minor hook order/usage fixes to satisfy strict React rules.

- Docs & DX
  - Root README documents the real stack, setup, DB defaults, and local run steps.
  - Verified production build via Vite; provided lint/install notes.

## Tools & libraries used

- Core: React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/Radix UI primitives
- Charts: Plotly.js + react-plotly.js, Recharts
- UI utilities: lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority
- Code/UX helpers: react-code-blocks (SQL), cmdk (palette)
- Observers: ResizeObserver, MutationObserver (native)
- Dev tooling: ESLint 9, @vitejs/plugin-react-swc, PostCSS, Autoprefixer

## Features working now

- Message thread without personas, clean left alignment
- Auto-resizing message composer with stable bottom padding
- Floating "new messages" indicator that doesnâ€™t get hidden by the input bar
- Analytics dashboard with active-tab-only render, scrollable analysis table, and aligned SQL inspector
- Cohesive mission-control look-and-feel with consistent spacing across panels

## Upcoming enhancements (shortlist)

- Streamed typing indicators and partial-response rendering from the backend
- Command palette actions and saved prompt templates for common ocean queries
- Client-side telemetry + error boundaries around heavy chart renders
- Lightweight skeleton loaders for tab/content transitions
- Accessibility: focus outlines, ARIA roles/labels, keyboard navigation polish
- Performance: code-split heavy charting libs; defer non-critical modules; reduce initial JS bundle

## How to demo

- Build & run (from `frontend/`):
  - Development: `npm run dev`
  - Production build: `npm run build` then `npm run preview`
- Validate:
  - Send a chat message and confirm the latest response stays visible.
  - Switch across Analysis/Map/Profiles/SQL; note that only the active tab renders.
  - Inspect SQL; verify consistent styling and readable formatting.

## Quality gates

- Build: PASS (Vite production build successful)
- Lint: Configure ESLint per root README notes if not already present; run `npm run lint`
