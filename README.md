# FloatAI

Production-ready instructions for running the FloatAI stack locally.

## What does FloatAI do?

FloatAI is a mission console for ARGO ocean intelligence:

- **Chat-to-Insight** – Scientists type plain-language questions; the backend orchestrates Gemini + SQL generation to surface float records, profiles, statistics, and maps.
- **Guided Analytics** – The UI narrates findings, summarizes trends, and pairs every chart with short, readable takeaways so teams can brief stakeholders quickly.
- **Transparent Data Provenance** – Every response links to the SQL used, making it easy to audit queries in pgAdmin or DBeaver, tweak them, and rerun variants.
- **Responsive Control Deck** – A focused-calm layout keeps the chat, charts, and tables aligned on an 8-point grid, even when handling dense telemetry.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (project tested with Python 3.13)
- **Node.js 18+** (for the Vite + React frontend)
- **PostgreSQL 14+** accessible at `localhost:5432`
- Recommended: [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for managing the `postgres` database

## 1. Configure environment variables

1. Duplicate the provided samples and fill in the secrets you were given:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   Copy-Item frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```
2. Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to your Gemini API key.
3. Either set `DATABASE_URL` **or** supply the granular `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` values. The defaults match your pgAdmin server named **postgres** (`postgres` / `Password You created when installing Postgres`).
4. Optionally restrict `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` to the frontend origin you deploy.

> ⚠️ Never check the populated `.env` files into source control.

## 2. Prepare the database

1. Create (or reuse) a PostgreSQL database called `postgres` (or adjust `DB_NAME` accordingly).
2. Ensure the `argo_profiles` table exists with the schema expected by the ETL pipeline.
3. (Optional) Run the ETL to load NetCDF data:
   ```powershell
   python data_pipeline/build_database.py
   ```

## 3. Build the FAISS knowledge base

If you change the curated knowledge, regenerate the vector store:
```powershell
python ai_core/create_vector_db.py
```

## 4. Run the backend API

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api_server.py
```

The FastAPI service listens on `http://localhost:8000` by default. Adjust `API_HOST`/`API_PORT` in `.env` to deploy to a different interface.

### API surface

The backend now exposes a small REST surface for operational telemetry in addition to `/api/ask`:

- `GET /api/stats` – aggregate fleet metrics (total floats, last ingest timestamp).
- `GET /api/floats` – latest position & health snapshot per float, filterable by ID/date window/status.
- `GET /api/floats/{id}/profiles/{variable}` – most recent profile curve for the given float (`temperature`, `salinity`, or `pressure`).
- `GET /api/floats/{id}/timeseries` – rolling time series (default: temperature) for charts and anomaly detection.
- `GET /api/floats/{id}/quality` – simple completeness scores powering the QA panels.

These routes back the map widgets and data panels in the FloatAI dashboard and degrade gracefully to sample data if the database is unreachable.

## 5. Run the frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server defaults to `http://localhost:5173`. The build step `npm run build` produces production assets in `frontend/dist`.

## 6. Smoke test

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in a browser.
2. Ask a data question in the **Chat Interface** and confirm:
   - The backend generates SQL (visible in the SQL tab).
   - The data grid and map update with results.
3. Try a conversational prompt (e.g., "Who are you?") and ensure the assistant responds without DB access.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Configuration error" responses**: The backend could not read required environment variables. Verify `.env` is in place and restart the API.
- **Database connection failures**: Confirm PostgreSQL is running and the credentials in `.env` are correct.
- **FAISS index errors**: Rebuild via `python ai_core/create_vector_db.py` and ensure `FAISS_INDEX_PATH` points to the generated folder.
- **CORS blocked**: Add your frontend origin to `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env` (comma-separated list).

## Deployment notes

- Configure HTTPS termination in front of FastAPI (e.g., via Nginx or a cloud load balancer).
- Store secrets in your platform's secret manager—never bake them into container images.
- Set `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend environment to the deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://api.yourdomain.com/api/ask`).
- Adjust `RAG_RETRIEVER_K` to trade off recall vs. performance when scaling.
